    # When releasing, there is a race condition in building the
    # documentation. Two commits are pushed in quick succession:
    #
    #  1. The release commit
    #  2. The commit that bumps the version to the new dev version
    #
    # Without the following conditional to skip the documentation build for
    # that second commit, both commits would trigger workflows that starts
    # around the same time, and the one that finishes first would cause the
    # other to fail when it tries to make a conflicting commit.
    #
    # Note: testing array[n] for null is the GitHub Actions way of checking
    # if the length of an array is <= n.
