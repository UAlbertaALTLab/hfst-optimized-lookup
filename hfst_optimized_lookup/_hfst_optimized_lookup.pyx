### String utilities
# These would go into a separate .pyx file if I could get that to compile

# This was tricky to figure out. If a param is declared as `char *`, then Cython
# will only accept `bytes` objects, causing no end of trouble for callers. But:
# “If no type is specified for a parameter or return value, it is assumed to be
# a Python object.” So not specifying a type means we get strings as
# `PyObject`s, which we can call `encode()` on to get `bytes` and pass them to
# the underlying `const char*`-taking function.
cdef bytes_from_cstring(s):
    if not isinstance(s, str):
        raise Exception("Passed non-string")
    return s.encode('UTF-8')


cdef cstring_to_str(const char*cstr):
    """Return a python copy of the given C string, after free()ing source

    This assumes that the argument was specifically malloc’d for the caller to
    free.
    """
    cdef bytes b
    try:
        b = cstr  # copy happens here
        return b.decode('UTF-8')
    finally:

        # originating from the constructor will not be handled by Cython.”

        self.c_tf = new TransducerFile(bytes_from_cstring(path))

    def symbol_count(self):
        return self.c_tf.symbol_count()

    def lookup(self, string):

        return [x.strip() for x in ret.split('\n') if x.strip()]
